				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p>I'm a front-end developer/designer based in sunny Philadelphia. I've been building websites since the late 1990s. Along the way I've been fortunate to apply my skills in design and front-end development to a wide variety of exciting projects. I've worked with a lot of great people, from large companies to small businesses and nonprofits. When I'm not working on the web, I enjoy traveling to foreign countries, listening to electronic music and taking photographs. I also love exploring the incredible city of Philadelphia on bicycle with my wife, Jamie.</p>

				<h2>Experience</h2>

				<div class="job">
					<h3><a href="http://slurve.com" title="Slurve">Slurve</a></h3>
					<h4>Philadelphia, PA<br>August 2006 - Present<br>Developer/Designer</h4>
					<p>I established Slurve (it's a baseball term -- a slider and curveball) back in 2006 after spending a decade working with some really smart folks at MLB.com, Yankees.com and Advance Digital. As a one-person shop, my focus has been building content-rich, user-friendly websites for all screen sizes and devices. More often than not, I'll use WordPress as a content management system, building custom, responsive themes using the latest coding trends. For most projects, I'll handle all aspects of the work myself, from the initial design mockups to the website launch. Other times, clients who already have a design in place will hire me to convert it to a custom WordPress theme. My niche of late has been working alongside marketing teams at mid-sized companies to assist in the planning and management of their public-facing marketing materials (website, blog, landing pages, etc.). <em>Skills: HTML5, CSS3 (Sass), JavaScript (jQuery), MySQL, PHP, WordPress (Custom Theme Development), Responsive Web Design, Grunt, Git.</em></p>

				<h3><a href="http://mlb.com" title="MLB Advanced Media">MLB.com</a></h3>
				<h4>New York, NY<br>November 2000 - August 2006<br>Front-end Developer</h4>
				<p>As the lead Front-End Developer for MLB.com and the 30 club websites, I was responsible for maintaining and building out new features for the network. I also worked closely with the MLB editorial team to develop sections for special events (Draft, Playoffs, All-Star Game) using MLB's content management system. <em>Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XSLT, JSP, WinCVS.</em></p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.yankees.com" title="Advance Internet">Yankees.com</a></h3>
				<h4>Bronx, NY<br>February 2000 - September 2000<br>Web Editor</h4>
				<p>I worked closely with the New York Yankees (PR department, publications department, players and coaches) and our lead beat writer onsite at Yankee Stadium to develop daily content for the website. As the "webmaster", I was in charge of day-to-day updates and maintenance. I also watched a ton of baseball. Yeah, I miss this job. <em>Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP.</em></p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.advancedigital.com" title="Advance Internet">Advance Digital</a></h3>
				<h4>Jersey City, NJ<br>April 1997 - February 2000<br>Web Editor</h4>
				<p>As a Web Editor, my job included adding content to the network of websites and building out new sections using HTML. I may have used the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element once or twice. <em>Skills: HTML, foosball, <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag.</em></h2>
